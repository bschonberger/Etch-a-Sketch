# Etch-a-Sketch

Using Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, I created this drawing application to practice more advanced DOM creation and manipulation techniques. With this Etch-a-Sketch clone you can customize the grid size, use different color features, and erase any mistakes you make in the process.
